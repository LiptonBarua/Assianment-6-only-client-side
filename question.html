    <h1>Question No-1</h1>
    <h3><span>Var</span>: The var statement declares a variable. Variables are containers for storing information. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.</h3>

     <h3><span>Let</span> let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope</h3>

     <h3><span>Const</span>: Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment .</h3>

     <h1>Question No-2</h1>
     <h3><span>Array function</span>: In JavaScript, Array is a built-in global object that allows you to store multiple elements at once. In this reference page, you will find all the Array methods and their properties. </h3>

     <h3><span>Regular functions</span>:Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. </h3>

     <h1>Question No-3</h1>
     <h3><span>Map:</span> map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. map() calls a function once for each element in an array.</h3>
     <h3><span>forEach: </span>The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.</h3>
     <h3><span>Filter:</span> The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function. The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements. The filter() method does not change the original array.</h3>
     <h3><span>Find: </span> The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find() method executes a function for each array element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements are found. The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.</h3>
